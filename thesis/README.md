# The Thesis Source

This directory contains the source files for the thesis itself.

## Tools

The thesis was authored entirely in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/),
with some diagrams done with [Tikz](https://tikz.net/). Python was used with
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to generate the graphs and charts from
the data that resulted from the experiments.

## Structure

The file `thesis.tex` is the "main" file of the thesis. It mostly just uses
`\input` to pull in the settings and the sections.

The file `setup.tex` contains all the package-loading and package configuration
code. It also defines the title as a command (to allow it to be changed in just
one place until it was finalized) and declares hyphenation for some words that
were breaking layout.

### The `code` directory

This directory contains the code samples that were included in the thesis
using the LaTeX [listings](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings) package. Each file
was first written without the `.tex` suffix, then wrapped in TeX commands and
renamed.

(Note that the Rust files require the file
[`listings-rust.sty`](listings-rust.sty) in order to be rendered properly by
the listings package.)

### The `content` directory

The files in this directory are the component parts of the thesis itself. Each
file is either a specific special page (`title.tex`, `committee.tex`,
`copyright.tex`) or a section.

### The `figures` directory

This directory contains the diagrams and images used in the thesis. The files
ending in the `.tex` suffix are Tikz diagrams. The following files were either
created manually or drawn from references cited within the paper:

* **data-center-energy.png** - taken from <https://www.akcp.com/blog/the-real-amount-of-energy-a-data-center-use/>
* **dna.png** - created by hand using stock tools on a MacBook Pro
* **dna2.png** - created by hand using an image from Google and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
* **mccabe.png** - created by hand using stock tools on a MacBook Pro

The remaining `*.png` files were created using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in the
[`process_results.py`](../src/util/process_results.py) script.

### The `tables` directory

All but two of the files in this directory were generated by the Python script
[`process_results.py`](../src/util/process_results.py). The hand-crafted files
are `hardware-specs.tex` and `software-specs.tex`.
